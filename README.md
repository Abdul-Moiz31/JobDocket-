## 🎯 What is JobDocket?

**JobDocket** is an intelligent Chrome extension that helps you track your job applications effortlessly. It automatically logs your job applications directly to your personal Google Sheets, so you never lose track of where you've applied, what positions you're interested in, or when you submitted applications.

Job hunting can be overwhelming—keeping track of every application, following up on opportunities, and staying organized is challenging. JobDocket simplifies this process by providing a seamless way to save and organize all your job applications in one place that you own and control.

## 💡 Why We Created JobDocket

Job searching is stressful enough without the added burden of manually tracking dozens of applications across multiple platforms. We created JobDocket to solve these common problems:

- **Lost Applications**: Ever forget where you applied or what jobs you were interested in? JobDocket keeps everything organized.
- **Manual Tracking**: Manually copying job details into spreadsheets is time-consuming and error-prone. JobDocket automates this process.
- **Data Ownership**: Your job search data is personal and important. With JobDocket, all your data stays in your own Google Sheets—you own it, you control it.
- **Efficiency**: Save time with smart auto-fill that extracts job information from popular job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor.

JobDocket empowers job seekers to stay organized, save time, and focus on what matters most—landing their dream job.
